# odds_scaper
Personal project to learn scraping, mongodb, flask, etc and generally improve python and project skills.

## General Info
Designed to extract information on current odds for various sporting events, to allow for plotting and data analysis of odds changes over time.  Data is then stored in a nosql database using pymongo for later analysis and visualization. 

## Current State
- Able to pull odds continously and store in test database for NBA,NHL,MLB-- untested for other sports.  Basic plotting available.  Bootstrap framework for easy, albeit semi-ugly, viz.
- Hosted on heroku & mongodb atlas for the DB, all free versions.   Initial deployment on 3/7/19, still evaluating bugs / ensuring functionality matches between local and hosted version.

Lots still to do!
