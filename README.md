# odds_scaper
Personal project to learn scraping, mongodb, flask, etc and generally improve python and project skills

## General Info
Designed to extract information on current odds for various sporting events, to allow for plotting and data analysis of odds changes over time.  Data is then stored in a nosql database using pymongo for later analysis. 

## Current State
- Able to pull odds continously and store in test database for NBA, untested for other sports.  No frontend / viz tools yet.
